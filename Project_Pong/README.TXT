HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
To start the Pong game, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the project files from the repository.
3. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
4. Run the compiled Java program to start the game.

AUTHORS:
This version of Pong was coded by Praneel Magapu.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Upon starting the game, you will see a simple interface displaying the paddles and the ball in the middle of the screen.
2. Use the arrow keys or designated keys to control the paddle on your side of the screen.
3. The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle in a way that prevents it from reaching your side of the screen while also trying to send it past your opponent's paddle.
4. The game continues until one player reaches a set score or until you exit the game.
5. Enjoy playing Pong!
